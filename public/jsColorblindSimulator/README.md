# jsColorblindSimulator

Simulate different kinds of color-blindness on images directly in your webbrowser.
All the processing is done locally and the images do not leave your computer.

# Try it [here](http://mapeper.github.io/jsColorblindSimulator/)

## About this project
This project is inspired by [Coblis - the Color BLIndness Simulator](http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).
But instead of uploading the images to a server it does all the image processing locally in your webbrowser.

You can choose between 2 different Simulation Algorithms *(Both are not proven to produce good or realistic results!)*:

##### The `ColorMatrix` Algorithm

But there is [this comment](http://kaioa.com/node/75#comment-247) which claims to be from the author:
> You're right, the ColorMatrix version is very simplified, and not accurate. I created that color matrix one night (http://www.colorjack.com/labs/colormatrix/)
and since then it's shown up many places... I should probably take that page down before it spreads more! Anyways, it gives you an idea of what it might look
like, but for the real thing...
